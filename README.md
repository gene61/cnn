# Diffraction Pattern Modeling and CNN Classification

The system models satellite-to-ground communication links (represented by black lines) where flying objects (simulated as green slabs) pass through the transmission path, creating detectable diffraction patterns at the ground receiver.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Generate Diffraction Patterns

#### Run single simulation
python diffraction_modell.py

example outputs:

#### Run batch simulations
./run_simulations.sh

### 2. Train CNN Model
python cnn_model_Aug.py
